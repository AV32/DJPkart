        "Performance was blazing quick too. Even with all its bells and whistles, FunTouch OS ran smoothly and was easy to master. I also found the biometrics to be very reliable, be it the fingerprint sensor or face recognition. Videos looked great on the phone's display, especially HDR content.",
        "One of the best looking phone in the market right now with a decent performance jump from 11 pro. Camera is excellent and the display is quite responsive and sharp. Only issue is it does not have a higher refresh rate and the battery life is average.",
        "I have upgraded from Android to iOS for the first time with the IPhone 12 Pro. And the experience is very much satisfactory. The new A14 bionic processor is very fast. The boxy design is what I liked the most. The camera and display are top notch. Night mode photography is excellent. Worth upgrading from Android to iOS .",
        "Awesome! Just made an upgrade from X, worth every single penny spent on it, the camera is just too superb, be it the selfie cam or the main rear cam, the goodness it takes the picture is just beyond words, no smart phone can beat it atm! However, the battery life tends to be on the shorter side, that‚Äôs the only con that I can‚Äôt think up of now.",

        `Good mobile poco m3
        Pros:
        Fullhd display,
        smooth tocuh response,
        6000mah battery,
        avarage weight,
        back disign amazing,
        no heatting issue,
        decent back camera
        Excellent sound quality it's very clear
        Cons:
        front camara not take a clear picture,
        Charging time to long .50% charging time 1 hour 35 minutes.
        Ovarall the price segment this mobile good`,
        "Sound quality super 3 type sound but camera selfie camera is not good &Back camera is normally or value of money. Totally side & angel to seen to parfect",
        `One word review " Value for Money"
        It has the potential to be a nice casual daily driver
        Speakers are loud...like seriously loud.
        Screen size is good
        Though being a LCD screen it produces decent colours. For the price at which it comes that more than enough.
        Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.
        6000 mA battery üîãüëçüèª
        Though it comes with a lot of bloatware but you can just uninstall most of them (excluding system apps)
        Finally the Verdict is that it's a good budget smartphone`,

        `1.Very Smooth user interface.
        2. Gives you easily Two Days of battery backup with average use.
        3. Hepatic feedback too good.
        4. In this price range Rear camera is Above average. Hope it should be improve in future updates. & Front camera perform very well.
        5. In hand feel is little bulky, it feel heavier than other phone due to its big 6000 mah battery
        6. Display size is very big ( 6.8 inches ) & bright.
        7. Voice call quality is very good & clear.
        8. Notification LED light is missing, but Previous Motorola phones have led notification light.
        9. You will definitely love the gesture controls of this phone.
        10. It is splash proof & water repellent design.
