      back disign amazing,
      no heatting issue,
      decent back camera
      Excellent sound quality it's very clear
      Cons:
      front camara not take a clear picture,
      Charging time to long .50% charging time 1 hour 35 minutes.
      Ovarall the price segment this mobile good`,

      `One word review " Value for Money"
      It has the potential to be a nice casual daily driver
      Speakers are loud...like seriously loud.
      Screen size is good
      Though being a LCD screen it produces decent colours. For the price at which it comes that more than enough.
      Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.
      6000 mA battery üîãüëçüèª
      Though it comes with a lot of bloatware but you can just uninstall most of them (excluding system apps)
      Finally the Verdict is that it's a good budget smartphone`,

      "Performance was blazing quick too. Even with all its bells and whistles, FunTouch OS ran smoothly and was easy to master. I also found the biometrics to be very reliable, be it the fingerprint sensor or face recognition. Videos looked great on the phone's display, especially HDR content. ",
      "Best Samsung phone in this price range.Good battery back up.Decent Display.Fast fingerprint sensor.Rear camera quality is good.front camera is not up to the mark.90 Hz refresh rate is good.Good user interface.updated to one ui 3.1.there are some pre installed apps which can only be disabled.sound quality is low comparing with other smartphones in same price segment.using in low screen bightness noticed screen flickering.",
      "First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful. Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone",
